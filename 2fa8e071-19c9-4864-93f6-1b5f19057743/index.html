nothing compared to my nerves about casting for Prada. Come on – it’s Prada
after all…an iconic Italian brand. I was still trying to figure out why they’d
want to see a curvy girl and at the same time trying not to look the gift horse
in the mouth.I did some research online
and did notice that their 2015 and upcoming 2016 collections were colourful,
retro styles and best of all weren’t tight on the hips. Maybe I could pull it
off after all. </p><p>Mum was still off from work so she hopped on the train with
me into the city on Friday 22 January 2016. I really do rely a lot on her for
moral support. And it’s also good to talk through my nerves with her before
castings, shoots or runway shows. I’m realizing that it’s a lot easier to
pursue a dream when you have someone in your corner who believes in you no
matter what. She’s told me more than once that she’s been able to pursue her
writing because her partner has been her cheerleader and supporter even through
the times when she can’t get a single word out on paper. She’s gotten through
writer’s block because he continued to encourage her to write, even if it was
only a hundred words at a time. I guess she does the same for me…helps me to
keep going even when I feel paralysed with fear or insecurity. </p><p>When we reached the Prada store at the Paris end of Collins
Street in Melbourne, mum kept strolling up the street and let me go in by
myself. I was nervous and became more so when I saw the outfit which was left out
for me to try on. I kept saying over and over to myself as I went to undress
“please let this outfit fit”. To my surprise and relief the outfit fit
beautifully and I felt amazing in it. The casting director took a head shot, a
medium length shot and a full length shot of me. And then it was over. It was
the shortest casting I’ve done so far, with very little conversation. In a
nutshell it came down to me fitting on the outfit and getting some photos taken
in it. I must say I didn’t really want to get out of it. It fit so well and I
felt so good in it, I really wanted to keep it. But all good things must come
to an end and I stepped out of the Prada outfit and store in less than 10
minutes of first walking in. </p><p>I don’t yet know if I got the job at Prada. I’ll find out in
the next day or two. But it did feel great casting for such a high end, popular
brand. I remembered to send my booking agent a thank you email for getting me
that casting, though I doubt my mum would’ve let me forget anyway. She’s big on
that kind of stuff – manners, thank you’s and courtesies and she’s been
drumming that into my head since I was young. So in the same week I fluctuated
between feelings of insecurity and feelings of beauty and self-confidence. I
suppose that’s the highs and lows of modelling and the world of fashion and
beauty. As long as I remember that it’s ok to experience both, keep things in
perspective and understand that the highs and lows are part of any dream and
everyday life I’ll stay strong enough to keep putting one stiletto in front of
the other, remembering the words of a fashion icon</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>“I always find beauty in things that
