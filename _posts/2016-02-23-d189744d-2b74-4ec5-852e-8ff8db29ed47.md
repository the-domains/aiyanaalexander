**_21 Jan 2016_**

Now that I've made the decision to give it my all as I chase
my career in fashion it's as though the universe wanted to test me. My agency
managed to get me three castings this past week. That's a lot for someone who
is just coming back into modelling after taking a year off to complete VCE. I
couldn't do one of the castings as the day and time didn't work for my schedule
or my mum's. She usually takes me as I still don't have my driver's license.
That's another story and it's enough to just say it's one of the many things I
need to tick off my "TO DO" list before I go to New York.

Anyway -- I went to the Virgin Australia Melbourne Fashion
Festival (VAMFF) casting on Wednesday 20th Jan 2016\. I was more than
nervous. I always get nervous -- doesn't matter what casting, photo shoot or
runway show, I'm usually quite wobbly on the inside. This time I was terrified.
It might have had something to do with the fact that it's been over a year
since I cast for anything. And there were so many beautiful girls there. I felt
intimidated. Mum dropped me off and then went down Glenferrie Road for a walk.
She's not been well and has been resting on the couch most days. She said she
needed a little exercise. She used to go with me to shoots, castings and so on
in the past, but now that I'm 18, she's trying to encourage me to be a little
more independent. My nerves were getting the better of me so I sent her a text
and it said:

"I'm honestly terrified"

Mum responds with, "Well you gotta draw the Goddess from
within because Jon just sent another casting through for you for Friday for Prada
for their show in Feb. This is your dream. Believe in yourself."

I reply with "I'm just super nervous because there are so
many gorgeous girls here and it's really intimidating. And now I'm panicking
because I only have one comp card."

As it turns out I didn't need more than the one comp card
because I did not move through to the next round. There were over 200 girls
casting. I was number 41\. The worst part of that casting was that the panel of
judges didn't even look at me. I had to walk with three other girls and I could
feel they were not even looking at me. It's a really crappy feeling. And to
make matters worse I knew my walk was rubbish too. I let my nerves get the
better of me and the fierce walks I'd practiced at home for mum flew out the
window. I felt unsure of myself and I'm sure it showed. Whether the judges
noticed or not, I can't say. Like I said they didn't even appear to look at me
at all. Number 41 was not even in the running. I wanted to cry. 

I called mum and told her I was ready. The "frog in my
throat" voice probably gave my disappointment away. But all she said was
"there'll be others and you have the Prada casting on Friday." It only helped a
little. I still couldn't believe Prada wanted to see me. I kept wondering if
they'd made a mistake, because my measurements are on the Scene website. Surely
they must've noticed I'm not super skinny. I felt so insecure. It's weird how
quickly insecurity can bubble up.

I mean I do believe in healthy body images so I don't
believe models should be overly thin or overly big either. I would never be a
promoter of anorexic looking figures nor would I be a promoter of obese
figures. Neither represents good health and wellbeing. But it's hard not to
feel insecure and a bit lacking when a panel of judges seem to light up at the
girls who are more on the skinny than the curvy side. Mum, as usual, didn't
allow me to feel sorry for myself for too long. 

She reminded me that the industry is very competitive and filled
with a lot more No's than Yes's and that not being selected in a casting
doesn't mean anything about me. It just means my look is not what they're after
at that particular time. She also reminded me that I could stop modelling at
any time if I found it too soul destroying and that I should only be pursing it
if I really loved it. Being a writer, I know she knows all about rejection.
After decades she's still writing, still chasing her dream to be a best-selling
author despite many rejection letters. 

After we talked through my feelings about the VAMFF casting
on the drive home, we turned our attention to the Prada casting and getting
ready for that. And if ever I needed to remember this bit of wisdom from Tyra
Banks, it was as I prepared for Prada.
